## Why you have developed this application?

I'm traveling to Phoenix (Arizona) for a few months and for applying my react-native lecture I decided to develop a mobile application for consulting the local time of cities, so I and my parents can use this application to know the time in each other city.

## I can improve this work with my contributing?

Yes, absolutely, I'm developing this application for learning react-native and improve my mobile develop skills, this project should be improved with the following addons:

- [ ] Introduce the patter MVC, in particular, the application component must be sub-divide in a "View" components, and a "Control" component;

- [X] Try to remove the API and work only with the library [Moment.js](https://momentjs.com/) or simile libraries;

- [X] Support different language, like:
    - [X] English
    - [X] Italian
    - [ ] Spanish
    - [ ] France

- [ ] Support the Web application.
